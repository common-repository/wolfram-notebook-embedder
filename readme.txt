Publish dynamic blog posts and web pages featuring Wolfram expressions or entire notebooks.

== Description ==
Bring the computational intelligence of the [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) directly to your WordPress site! With the [Wolfram Notebook Embedder](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/WolframNotebookEmbedder/) plugin, you can liven up your pages with interactive visualizations, augment your content with real-world knowledge or publish an entire Wolfram Notebook as a standalone website.

### Simple, Seamless Notebook Embedding

Showcase notebooks on your WordPress site without the clutter of iframes. Any expression published in the Wolfram Cloud can be embedded with responsive resizing or constrained dimensions depending on your preferences. 

### Add Instant Interactivity to Your Content

Let readers explore your computations interactively. You decide which elements to render and whether to allow dynamic manipulation for each. A JavaScript-powered back end provides smooth real-time interactivity.

### Start-to-Finish Publishing Workflow

Get from concept to completion faster with an all-in-one workflow. You can develop and format your content interactively in a Wolfram Notebook with full access to the computational power of the Wolfram Language. Once published to the [Wolfram Cloud](https://www.wolframcloud.com/), your notebook can be embedded immediately through WordPress using the Wolfram Notebook Embedder plugin.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Why isn't my embedded notebook loading?
Be sure the notebook you're trying to embed is _public_. You do not have to be signed in to the Wolfram Cloud to use this plugin. If you are being asked to do so, your notebook isn't public. More information about embedding notebooks in general can be found [here](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/WolframNotebookEmbedder/docs/Troubleshooting/).

Why did the styling on my page or in my notebook change after embedding?
This could be due to a bug in the notebook's CSS OR due to your page's CSS definitions "leaking" into the notebook. Please see [this page](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/WolframNotebookEmbedder/docs/Troubleshooting/) for troubleshooting this issue.

== Screenshots ==
1. The plugin opens this form for embedding the notebook. Width, maximum height and block interactivity are all optional. If width and height are empty, the notebook will fill the container area.
2. If you use the classic editor in Text mode, the plugin appears on the toolbar as a text button. Clicking it will insert the plugin code at your cursor location.
3. If you use the classic editor in Visual mode, the plugin icon appears on the toolbad. Clicking the icon will insert the plugin code at your cursor location.
